## Instructions (highest priority)
- [x] Ensure the 3D star field renders with bloom post-processing (UnrealBloomPass via @react-three/postprocessing)
- [x] Make branch lines glow with neon colors — each branch a different hue
- [x] Add subtle camera auto-rotation when idle (orbit slowly around the scene)
- [x] Timeline slider must show date labels and animate star appearances chronologically
- [x] Configure vite.config.ts base path: '/chronoscape/' for GitHub Pages
- [x] Add .github/workflows/deploy.yml for GitHub Pages deployment
- [x] Bundle a compelling demo dataset with at least 200 commits showing interesting branch patterns

## Feedback
- The space theme should feel immersive — add distant star particles in the background
- Stars should twinkle subtly when not selected

## Direction
- This is the visual showpiece — pure wow factor
